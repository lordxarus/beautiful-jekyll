## What are Prison Autominers?
If you're familiar with prison themed MineCraft servers, please skip down to the next header. If you aren't familiar, let me explain. Prison servers are largely a grindfest, where-in players mine to level up through various alphabetically organized mine areas. More or less, prison servers are similar in theory to idle games, except instead of a complicated system it's just mining blocks in a square area and progressing further and further. There are more elements to this type of thing but generally that's the basic idea.

So, what you'll find is that most servers will offer an "AutoMiner" feature. Basically these are NPC characters that bring up a chest GUI which players use to interface with the AutoMiner. It's very abstracted, and in a lot of ways not tactile. Most players don't connect with the feature, and in the world of MineCraft server operations, everything needs to be monetized better by providing better experiences. Below, you'll find a GIF of a common AutoMiner plugin in operation.

## So, What's the Solution?
More or less, using the NPC system that MineCraft provides, you can easily make a much more engaging, unique, player experience. Below you can find a GIF of the prototype plugin.
