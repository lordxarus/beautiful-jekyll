There is nothing worse than trying your hardest and failing. Life is funny in that way, one learns best from pain. Good things don't shape us like tumult does. Sometimes though, one gets tired of trying. The situation arises and one is tired, no longer knows what to do and sees no path forward. Overwhelm sets in.

The author believes that these moments are the times we are forced to find ourselves. As cliche as it is, nothing that is worth while is easy. Life is unequivocally worth while. Yet, it never seems that way until it is.

Just remember, everyone single member of the human race is a piece of the infinite possibilities of the universe. It's not as scary to look inside as some think. Running can only get you so far, the feelings of overwhelm and lack of direction come from our running. We know why we're here, that little voice that always get beat down by logic and seeking of security is what we should follow. Everything is a lesson, love the lessons because once you learn them all you're gone.

Life is too short to be swallowed up by the past and the future. All we have is now. Simply a choice between your soul or your brain, in everything. Listen to yourself, let yourself be heard. Things will change, as they always have. It's our choice how they do.
